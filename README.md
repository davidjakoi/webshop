# Webshop

The purpose of the project is to let users select products they need and put them into their cart. There are two pages: products and cart.
On the products page there is a list of products in a table with all of their details, from which the user can add the chosen amount of items to their shopping cart. They can navigate to the cart page to see the items they added and the total price, also they can delete items from the cart.
Adding or deleting items from the cart changes the available amount of items.
